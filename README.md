# Multi AI Agents with RAG

This project demonstrates the development of a multi-agent AI chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangGraph and AstraDB. The system enables dynamic routing of user queries between a vector database and external tools like Wikipedia, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language processing.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent System**: Dynamically routes user queries to the appropriate AI agent.
- **RAG Implementation**: Combines retrieval and generation for accurate responses.
- **External Integration**: Utilizes Wikipedia and other external resources to enhance AI capabilities.
